## Overview

This is a modification of the excellent Chrome extension [Codingpad by Felix Kling](http://felix-kling.de/). It allows to quickly upload and execute code snippets on [ideone.com](ideone.com) and seeing their output immediately, without opening their webpage.

## Installation

For now, you can install this extension by cloning the repository and adding the unpacked extension in Chrome's developer mode.
